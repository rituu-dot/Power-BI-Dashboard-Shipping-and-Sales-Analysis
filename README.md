# Power-BI-Dashboard-Shipping-and-Sales-Analysis
Visualizing shipped boxes and revenue trends by country, product, and time (year, quarter, month) for actionable insights.

This Power BI dashboard analyzes shipping and sales data across countries and products, providing actionable insights from raw data. It includes four main sections: total boxes shipped by country, revenue trends over year, quarter, and month, boxes shipped by product, and revenue patterns by time and product. The dashboard highlights top-performing countries, identifies in-demand products, and tracks revenue drivers across different periods. This project demonstrates skills in data visualization, interactive reporting, and data-driven decision-making using Power BI.
